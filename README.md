# Medium Requester

This just contains 2 simple methods to retrieve a user and their individual posts off of Medium.com. 
This does not require a key or any other form of integration.

## How To:

This project currently contains two methods:
- getUser
- getUserPost

### getUser
getUser just requires you to pass a username. This will return the full user payload.

### getUserPosts
getUserPosts requires you to pass a username and article ID. This will return the article payload.
